I want to show you something. What I'm going to show is a general testing
principle, applied to a React component test. So even though the example is a
React one, hopefully it helps communicate the concept properly.

<callout-info class="aside">
  Note: my point isn't that nesting is bad by itself, but rather that it
  naturally encourages using test hooks (such as `beforeEach`) as a mechanism
  for code reuse which does lead to unmaintainable tests. Please read on...
